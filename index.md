## UV and BV electrograms for LV endocardium

Statistics of UV and BV for LV segments due to:

Notation of activation patterns:

1. lv - LV free wall activation
2. 2p - Activation at LV free wall and on RV near to apex.
3. s20 - Activation of 20% of LV subendocardial surface from the apex.
4. s100 - Activation of entire LV subendocardial surface.

Bipolar electrograms were evaluated at each point of the endocardial surface LV 
as the difference of signals between points at a distance of 5 mm from each other
in a certain direction.

Thus, the bipolar electrogram is correlated with the directivity derivative 
of a unipolar electrogram. That is, BV has high values if the BV electrode is 
located in the direction of the excitation wave.
